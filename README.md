# Hello, I'm Davit Shanshashvili! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I am a newcomer to the IT field, having transitioned from a 12-year career as a senior officer in the Georgian Air Force, where I held various responsible positions. This experience has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and leadership—qualities that I believe are essential in the dynamic environment of DevOps. Following my tenure in the military, I spent over two years in civil aviation, which further honed my ability to manage critical tasks and work under pressure.

My interest in DevOps engineering has grown significantly during this time, and I have dedicated myself to self-education in the field. I have gained proficiency in several key areas, including:

## Skills
- Networking: CCNA - Routing and Switching
-	Operating Systems: Linux System Administration RHEL9
-	Web Servers: Apache HTTPD, Nginx
-	Application Servers: Apache Tomcat
-	Programming & Scripting Languages: Python, Bash Script
-	CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, Docker
-	Build & Dependency Management: Maven
-	Version Control: GitHub (GitHub Action), GitLab (GitLab CI/DC)
-	Databases: MySQL

During my learning journey, I had the opportunity to work with various tools such as SonarQube, Nexus, and AWS (including EC2, ECR, ECS, NLB/ELB), along with several databases.

I recognize that my current knowledge and skills in the DevOps field are not yet sufficient to fully meet the demands of a DevOps Engineer role. Therefore, I am committed to furthering my education and deepening my understanding of essential DevOps practices, tools, and methodologies. I am eager to explore advanced concepts and gain practical experience that will enable me to excel in this dynamic field.

# Hello, I'm Davit Shanshashvili! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I am a DevOps Engineer, having transitioned from a 12-year career as a senior officer in the Georgian Air Force, where I held various responsible positions. This experience has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and leadershipâ€”qualities that I believe are essential in the dynamic environment of DevOps. Following my tenure in the military, I spent over two years in civil aviation, which further honed my ability to manage critical tasks and work under pressure.

My interest in DevOps engineering has grown significantly during this time, and I have dedicated myself to self-education in the field. I have gained proficiency in several key areas, including:

During my learning journey, I had the opportunity to work with various tools such as SonarQube, Nexus, and AWS (including EC2, ECR, ECS, NLB/ELB), along with several databases.

What's more, I am proud to share that I have successfully completed the **DevOps Fundamentals** course at **EPAM Systems**. This milestone has deepened my passion for DevOps and strengthened my drive to master its practices and tools. I am eager to apply the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained in real-world settings and contribute effectively to this dynamic field.

At the same time, I recognize that my current expertise in DevOps is a stepping stone rather than the destination. I am fully committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My focus is on deepening my understanding of essential DevOps methodologies, tools, and best practices while advancing into more complex concepts. Through hands-on experience and dedicated effort, I aim to refine my skills and confidently meet the challenges of a DevOps Engineer role.

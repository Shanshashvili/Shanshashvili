# Hello, I'm Davit Shanshashvili! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I am a Junior DevOps Engineer, having transitioned from a 12-year career as a senior officer in the Georgian Air Force, where I held various responsible positions. This experience has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and leadershipâ€”qualities that I believe are essential in the dynamic environment of DevOps. Following my tenure in the military, I spent over two years in civil aviation, which further honed my ability to manage critical tasks and work under pressure.

My interest in DevOps engineering has grown significantly during this time, and I have dedicated myself to self-education in the field. I have gained proficiency in several key areas, including:

## Skills
